<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"A Late Symposium! Yet they're not engaged</p>
<p class="i0">In compotations. Argument hath raged</p>
<p class="i2">Four hours by the dial;</p>
<p class="i0">But zealotry of party, creed, or clique</p>
<p class="i0">Marks not the clock, whilst of polemic pique</p>
<p class="i2">There's one unvoided vial."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">So smiled the Shade. Dusk coat and gleaming head,</p>
<p class="i0">Viewed from above, before my gaze outspread</p>
<p class="i2">Like a black sea bespotted</p>
<p class="i0">With bare pink peaks of coral isles; all eyes</p>
<p class="i0">Were fixed on one who reeled out rhapsodies</p>
<p class="i2">In diction double-shotted.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">A long and lofty room, with pillars cold,</p>
<p class="i0">And spacious walls of chocolate and gold;</p>
<p class="i2">The solid sombre glory</p>
<p class="i0">Of tint oppressive and of tasteless shine,</p>
<p class="i0">Dear to the modern British Philistine,</p>
<p class="i2">Saint, sceptic, Whig, or Tory.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"No Samson-strength of intellect or taste</p>
<p class="i0">Shall bow the pillars of this temple chaste</p>
<p class="i2">Of ugliness and unction.</p>
<p class="i0">What is't they argue lengthily and late?</p>
<p class="i0">The flame of patriot passion for the State</p>
<p class="i2">Fires this polemic function.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"A caitiff Government has done a thing</p>
<p class="i0">To make its guardian-angel droop her wing</p>
<p class="i2">In sickened indignation:</p>
<p class="i0">That is, has striven to strengthen its redoubts,</p>
<p class="i0">Perfidious 'Ins,' to foil the eager 'Outs.'</p>
<p class="i2">Hence endless execration.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Hence all Wire-pullerdom is up in arms;</p>
<p class="i0">With clarion-toned excursions and alarms</p>
<p class="i2">The rival camp is ringing.</p>
<p class="i0">Hence perky commoners and pompous peers,</p>
<p class="i0">'Midst vehement applause and volleying cheers,</p>
<p class="i2">Stale platitudes are stringing.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The British Public&mdash;some five hundred strong&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">Is here to 'strangle a Gigantic Wrong,'&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">So <span class="smcap">Marabout</span> is saying.</p>
<p class="i0">Watch his wide waistcoat and his wandering eyes,</p>
<p class="i0">His stamping boots of Brobdingnagian size,</p>
<p class="i2">Clenched hands, and shoulders swaying.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"A great Machine-man, <span class="smcap">Marabout!</span> He dotes</p>
<p class="i0">On programmes hectographed and Party votes.</p>
<p class="i2">For all his pasty pallor</p>
<p class="i0">And shifty glance, he has the mob's regard,</p>
<p class="i0">And he is deemed by council, club, and ward</p>
<p class="i2">A mighty man of valour.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"A purchased henchman to a Star of State?</p>
<p class="i0">Perhaps. But here he'll pose and perorate,</p>
<p class="i2">A Brutus vain and voluble.</p>
<p class="i0">And who, like <span class="smcap">Marabout</span>, with vocal flux</p>
<p class="i0">Of formulas, can settle every <i>crux</i></p>
<p class="i2">That wisdom finds insoluble?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"'Hear! hear!' That shibboleth of shallow souls</p>
<p class="i0">Around his ears in clamorous cadence rolls;</p>
<p class="i2">He swells, he glows, he twinkles;</p>
<p class="i0">The sapient Chairman wags his snowy pate,</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst cynic triumph, cautious yet elate,</p>
<p class="i2">Lurks laughing in his wrinkles.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"And there sits honest zeal, absorbed, intent,</p>
<p class="i0">And cheerfully credulous. <span class="smcap">Marabout</span> has bent</p>
<p class="i2">To the Commercial Dagon</p>
<p class="i0">He publicly derides; but many here</p>
<p class="i0">Will toast 'his genuine grit, his manly cheer,'</p>
<p class="i2">Over a friendly flagon.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Look on him later! There he snugly sits</p>
<p class="i0">With his rich patron. Were it war of wits</p>
<p class="i2">That wakes their crackling chuckles,</p>
<p class="i0">They scarce were heartier. It would strangely shock</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Marabout's</span> worshippers to hear him mock</p>
<p class="i2">The 'mob' to which he truckles.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Truckles in platform speech. In club-room chat</p>
<p class="i0">With <span class="smcap">Wagstaff</span>, shrewd wire-puller, flushed and fat,</p>
<p class="i2">Or <span class="smcap">Dodd</span>, the rich dry-salter,</p>
<p class="i0">You'd hear how supply he can shift and twist,</p>
<p class="i0">How <span class="smcap">Brutus</span> with 'the base Monopolist'</p>
<p class="i2">Can calmly plot and palter,"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Whilst <span class="smcap">Marabouts</span> abound, O Shade," I cried,</p>
<p class="i0">"What wonder men are 'Mugwumps?'" Then my guide</p>
<p class="i2">Laughed low. "The &aelig;sthetic villa</p>
<p class="i0">Finds Shopdom's zeal on its fine senses jar;</p>
<p class="i0">Yet the Mugwumps Charybdis stands not far</p>
<p class="i2">From the Machine-man's Scylla.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Culture derides the Caucus for its heat,</p>
<p class="i0">Its hate&mdash;its absence of the Light and Sweet,</p>
<p class="i2">So jays might flout the vulture.</p>
<p class="i0">Partisan bitterness and purblind haste?</p>
<p class="i0">Come, view the haunts of dilettante Taste,</p>
<p class="i2">The coteries of Culture!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Here <i>Savants</i> wrangle o'er a fossil bone,</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Champer</span>, with curling lip and caustic tone,</p>
<p class="i2">At <span class="smcap">Ruddiman</span> is railing.</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Champer</span> knows everything, from <span class="smcap">Plato's</span> text</p>
<p class="i0">To Protoplasm; yet his soul is vext,</p>
<p class="i2">His cheeks with spite are paling.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Why? Because <span class="smcap">Ruddiman</span>, the rude, robust,</p>
<p class="i0">Has pierced with logic's vigorous vulgar thrust</p>
<p class="i2">The shield of icy polish.</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Champer</span>, in print, is hot on party-hate,</p>
<p class="i0">Here his one aim is in the rough debate</p>
<p class="i2">His rival to demolish.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Sweet Reasonableness? Another host</p>
<p class="i0">Of sages see! The habits of the Ghost,</p>
<p class="i2">The Astral Body's action,</p>
<p class="i0">Absorb them, eager. Does more furious fire</p>
<p class="i0">The councils of the Caucusites inspire,</p>
<p class="i2">Or light the feuds of faction?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"And there? They argue out with toil intense</p>
<p class="i0">A 'cosmic' poet's esoteric sense,</p>
<p class="i2">Of which a world, unwitting,</p>
<p class="i0">Recks nothing. Yet how terribly they'd trounce</p>
<p class="i0">Parliament's pettifogging, and denounce</p>
<p class="i2">'Political hair-splitting'!"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"O Shade, the difference is but small, one dreads.</p>
<p class="i0">Betwixt logomachists at loggerheads,</p>
<p class="i2">Whether their theme be bonnets</p>
<p class="i0">Or British interests. Zealot ardour burns</p>
<p class="i0">Scarce fiercer o'er Electoral Returns</p>
<p class="i2">Than over <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> Sonnets.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"At <span class="smcap">Marabout</span> the Mugwump sniffs and sneers;</p>
<p class="i0">Gregarious 'votes of thanks' and sheepish 'cheers'</p>
<p class="i2">Stir him to satire scornful.</p>
<p class="i0">But when sleek Culture apes, irate and loud,</p>
<p class="i0">The follies of the Caucus and the Crowd,</p>
<p class="i2">The spectacle is mournful."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"True!" smiled the Shade. "Yon supercilious sage,</p>
<p class="i0">With patent prejudice and petty rage,</p>
<p class="i2">Penning a tart jobation</p>
<p class="i0">On practised Statesmen, must as much amuse</p>
<p class="i0">As Statesmen-sciolists venting vapid views</p>
<p class="i2">On rocks and revelation."</p>

<h2>THE CAPTAIN OF THE "PARIS."</h2>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Captain <span class="smcap">Sharp</span>, of the Newhaven steamer, <i>Paris, you</i>'re no craven;</p>
<p class="i2">Grim and growling was the gale that you from your dead reckoning bore;</p>
<p class="i0">And, but for your brave behaving, she might never have made haven,</p>
<p class="i2">But have foundered in mid-Channel, or been wrecked on a lee-shore.</p>
<p class="i0">With your paddle-floats unfeathered, wonder was it that you weathered</p>
<p class="i2">Such a storm as that of Sunday, which upset our nerves on land,</p>
<p class="i0">Though in fire-side comfort tethered. How it blew, and blared, and blethered!</p>
<p class="i2">All your passengers, my Captain, say your pluck and skill were grand.</p>
<p class="i0">Much to men like you is owing, when wild storms around are blowing,</p>
<p class="i2">As they seem to have been doing since the opening of the year:</p>
<p class="i0">Howling, hailing, sleeting, snowing; but for captains calm and knowing,</p>
<p class="i2">Passage of our angry Channel were indeed a task of fear.</p>
<p class="i0">Well, you brought them safely through it, when not every man could do it,</p>
<p class="i2">And your passengers, my Captain, are inspired with gratitude.</p>
<p class="i0">Therefore, <i>Mr. Punch</i> thus thanks you, and right readily enranks you,</p>
<p class="i2">As a hero on the record of our briny island brood.</p>
<p class="i0">Verily the choice of "<i>Paris</i>" in this case proved right; and rare is</p>
<p class="i2">Fitness between name and nature such as that <i>you</i> illustrate.</p>
<p class="i0">Captain <span class="smcap">Sharp</span>! A proper <i>nomen</i>, and it proved a prosperous omen</p>
<p class="i2">To your passengers, whom <i>Punch</i> must on their luck congratulate.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>The title of the second chapter of <i>The Days of the Dandies</i>, in
<i>Blackwood</i>, is calculated to excite curiosity,&mdash;it is, "Some Great
Beauties, and some Social Celebrities." After reading the article, I
think it would have been styled more correctly, "A Few Great Beauties."
However, it is discursively amusing and interesting. There is much truth
in the paper on Modern Mannish Maidens. I hold that no number of a
Magazine is perfect without a tale of mystery and wonder, or a
ghost-story of some sort. I hope I have not overlooked one of these in
any Magazine for this month that I have seen. Last month there was a
good one in <i>Macmillan</i>, and another in <i>Belgravia</i>. I forget their
titles, unfortunately, and have mislaid the Magazines. But
<i>After-thoughts</i>, in this month's <i>Macmillan</i>, is well worth perusal.</p>

<p>My faithful "Co." has been looking through the works of reference. He
complains that <i>Dod's Peerage, Baronetage, and Knighthood for 1890</i> is
carelessly edited. He notes, as a sample, that Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Leland
Harrison</span>, who is said to have been born in 1857, is declared to have
entered the Indian Civil Service in 1860, when he was only three years
old&mdash;a manifest absurdity. As <i>Mr. Punch</i> himself pointed out this
<i>b&ecirc;tise</i> in <i>Dod's &amp;c., &amp;c., for 1889</i>, it should have been corrected in
the new edition. "If this sort of thing continues," says the faithful
"Co.," "<i>Dod</i> will be known as <i>Dodder</i>, or even <i>Dodderer</i>!" Sir
<span class="smcap">Bernard Burke's</span> <i>Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and
Baronetage</i> is, in every sense, a noble volume, and seems to have been
compiled with the greatest care and accuracy. <span class="smcap">Kelly's</span> <i>Post Office
Directory</i>, of course, is a necessity to every man of letters.
<i>Whitaker's Almanack for 1890</i> seems larger than usual, and better than
ever. <span class="smcap">Webster's</span> <i>Royal Red Book</i>, and <span class="smcap">Gardiner's</span> <i>Royal Blue Book</i>, it
goes without saying, are both written by men of address. <i>The Century
Atlas and Gazetteer</i> is a book amongst a hundred. Finally, the <i>Era
Almanack for 1890</i>, conducted by <span class="smcap">Edward Ledger</span>, is, as usual, full of
information concerning things theatrical&mdash;some of it gay, some of it
sad. "Replies to Questions by Actors and Actresses" is the liveliest
contribution in the little volume. The Obituary contains the name of
"<span class="smcap">Edward Litt Leman Blanchard</span>," dramatist, novellist, and journalist, who
died on the 4th of September, 1889. It is hard to realise the <i>Era
Almanack</i> without the excellent contributions of poor "E. L. B.!"</p>

<p>"Co." furnishes some other notes in a livelier strain:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matthew Prior.</i> (<span class="smcap">Kegan Paul.</span>) If you are asked to go out in this
abominable weather, shelter yourself under the wing of Mr. <span class="smcap">Austin
Dobson</span>, and plead a prior engagement. (Ha! Ha!) You will find the
engagement both prior and profitable. Mr. <span class="smcap">Dobson's</span> introductory essay is
not only exhaustive, but in the highest degree interesting, and his
selection from the poems has been made with great taste and rare
discretion.</p>

<p><i>In the Garden of Dreams.</i> The lack of poets of the softer sex has been
recently a subject of remark. Lady-novelists we have in super-abundance,
of lady-dramatists we have more than enough, of lady-journalists we have
legions&mdash;but lady-poets we have but few. Possibly, they flourish more on
the other side of the Atlantic. At any rate we have a good example of
the American Muse in the latest volume by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Louise Chandler Moulton</span>.
This little book is full of grace, its versification is melodious, and
has the genuine poetic ring about it, which is as rare as it is
acceptable. It can scarcely fail to find favour with English readers.</p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Commemoration Birthday Concert</span>.&mdash;The programme you are preparing, after
the fashion set the other evening in St. James's Hall, at an
entertainment organised in honour of the birthday of the poet <span class="smcap">Burns</span>, for
the purpose of paying a similar tribute to the memory of his great
fellow-countryman, Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>, certainly promises well. As you
very truly point out that, as at the Concert which you are taking as
your model, though the name of <span class="smcap">Burns</span> was tacked on to nearly every item
in the programme, as if he had been responsible for the words, music and
all, it did not seem limited to the Poet's work alone, you might
certainly allow yourself the latitude you propose in arranging your own
scheme. The fact that, at the Burns Celebration, <span class="smcap">M. Nachez</span> played his
own Hungarian dances, the connection between which and the Poet's
birthday is not, at first sight, entirely obvious, and that another
gentleman, with equal appropriateness, favoured the company with "<i>The
Death of Nelson</i>," on the trombone, seems certainly to give you a
warrant for the introduction you contemplate making, in commemoration of
Sir <span class="smcap">Walter</span>, of the Chinese Chopstick Mazurka, and the Woora-woora
Cannibal Islanders side-knife and sledge-hammer war-dance. It may of
course be possible, in a remote way, to introduce them, as you suggest,
into <i>Old Mortality</i>, but we should think you would be nearer the mark
with that other item of your programme, that associates <i>Jem Baggs</i> with
<i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>. Your idea of accepting and utilising the
offer of the <span class="smcap">Giralfi</span> family to introduce their Drawing-room
Entertainment into your programme seems excellent, and has certainly as
much in common with the Birthday of Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span> as the "<i>Death of
Nelson</i>," on the trombone, has with that of the distinguished Novelist's
great brother Poet. There is no reason, as you further point out, why
you should not organise a whole Series of Commemorative Birthday
Entertainments, as you think of doing, on the same plan, and with
<span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>, <span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>, Dr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, and <span class="smcap">Warren Hastings</span>, the celebrities
you mention, to begin upon, you ought to have no difficulty in working
in the solo on the big drum, the performance of the Learned Hy&aelig;na, the
Japanese Twenty-feet Bayonet-jump, and the other equally appropriate
attractions with which you are already in communication. Anyhow, begin
with Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>, following the St. James's Hall lead, and let us
hear how you get on.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Striking Wedding Presents</span>.&mdash;As you seem to think that a list of the
presents made to your young friends who are about to be married will in
all probability be published in some of the Society papers, "with the
names of the donors," we think, on the whole, we would advise you <i>not</i>
to give them, as you seem rather inclined to do, those three hundred
weight of cheap sardines of which you became possessed through a seizure
of your agents for arrears of rent. You might certainly present them
with the disabled omnibus horse that came into your hands on the same
occasion. Horses are sometimes given as wedding presents. There were
four down in a list of gifts at a fashionable marriage only last week.
But, of course, it would not suit your purpose to appear as the donor of
a "damaged" creature. We think, perhaps, it would be wiser to accept the
five pounds offered you through the veterinary surgeon you mention, and
lay out the money, as you suggest, in sixteen hundred Japanese fans. If
it falls through, and you find the horse still on your hands, there is
no need to mention its association with the omnibus. "Mr. <span class="smcap">John
Johnson</span>&mdash;a riding horse," doesn't read badly. We almost think this is
better than the fans. Think it over.</p>

<h2>THE LUXURY OF PANTOMIME.</h2>

<p>One day last week, after a struggle for life, Her Majesty's Theatre was
shut up, five hundred persons, so it was stated, lost employment, and
the <i>Cinderella</i> family, proud sisters and all, nay, even the gallant
Prince himself, were turned adrift. Smiling, at the helm of the Drury
Lane Ship, stands <span class="smcap">Augustus Druriolanus</span>, who sees, not unmoved, the wreck
of "Her Majesty's Opposition," and murmurs to himself as <i>Jack and the
Beanstalk</i> continues its successful course, "This is, indeed, the
survival of the fittest," and, charitably, <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> sends out a
life-boat entitled "Benefit Performance" to the rescue of the
shipwrecked crew. <i>Ave C&aelig;sar</i>!</p>

<p>From this disaster there results a moral, "which, when found," it would
be as well to "make a note of." It is this: as evidently London will
not, or cannot, support two Pantomimes, several Circuses, and a Show
like <span class="smcap">Barnum's</span>, all through one winter, why try the experiment?
especially when the <i>luxe</i> of Pantomime, fostered by <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span>, is so
enormous, that any competitor must be forced into ruinous and even
reckless extravagance, in order to enter into anything like rivalry with
The Imperator who "holds the field" for Pantomime, just as he holds "The
Garden" for Opera, against all comers.</p>

<p>These rival establishments only do harm to one another, spoil the public
by indulging their taste for magnificent spectacle, increasing in
gorgeousness every year, until true Pantomime will be overlaid with
jewelled armour, crushed under velvet and gold, and be lying helpless
under the weight of its own gorgeosity. We should question whether the
Olympian <span class="smcap">Barnum</span> has done much good for himself, seeing how gigantic the
expenses must be; and certainly he can't have done good to the theatres.
As to Shows, "The more the merrier" does not hold good. "The fewer the
better" is nearer the mark in every sense, and perhaps the experience of
this season may suggest even to <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> to give the public still
more fun for their money (and there is plenty of genuine fun in <i>Jack
and the Beanstalk</i>), with less show, in less time, and at consequently
less expense to himself, and with, therefore, bigger profits. We shall
see.</p>

<h2>KICKED!</h2>

<h4>(<i>By the Foot of Clara Groomley.</i>)<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">In Four Chapters.&mdash;III.</span></h4>

<p>Nothing done! The whole Detective force of London, having nothing better
to do, were placed at my disposal, and, after three weeks' search, they
found a girl called <span class="smcap">Smith</span>; but it was the wrong one. My darling is
<i>blonde</i>, and this was a dark, almost a black, <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. I came back to
Ryde in a passion and a third-class carriage. I find from Mademoiselle
that Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span> has not yet returned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> seemed pleased to see me, but he noticed that in my anxiety and
preoccupation I had forgotten to have my hat ironed. The hotel is quite
full, and I am to sleep in the Haunted Room to-night.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I am not a hysterical man, and this is not a neurotic story. It is, as a
matter of fact, the same old rot to which the shilling shockers have
made us accustomed. I cannot account in any way for my experiences last
night in the Haunted Room, but they certainly were not due to
nervousness. I had not been asleep long before I had a most curious and
vivid dream. I felt that I was not in the hotel, and that at the same
time I was not out of it. I had a curious sense of being everywhere in
general, and nowhere in particular.</p>

<p>I saw before me a gorgeously furnished room. On the tiger-skin rug
before the fire was a basket with a crewel-worked chair-back spread over
it. <i>What was in the basket?</i> Again and again I asked myself that
question. I felt like a long-division sum, and a cold shiver went down
my quotient.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room stood a man of about thirty, with a handsome,
wicked face. One hand rested on the drawer of a writing-table. Slowly he
drew from it a folded paper, and read, in a harsh, raucous voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'To cleaning and repairing one&mdash;&mdash;' No, that's not it."</p>

<p>He selected another paper. Ah, it was the right one this time!</p>

<p>"'Memorandum of Aunt <span class="smcap">Jane's</span> Will.' 'All property to go to <span class="smcap">Alice Smith</span>,
unless Aunt <span class="smcap">Jane's</span> poodle, <i>Tommy Atkins</i>, dies before <span class="smcap">Alice Smith</span> comes
of age. In which case, it all goes to me.' I remember making that note
when the will was read. And now"&mdash;he glanced at the covered
basket&mdash;"<i>Tommy</i>'s kicked the bucket. Well, he stood in my way. Who's to
know? But there must be no <i>post-mortem</i>, no 'vet' fetched in. Happy
thought&mdash;I'll have the brute stuffed." He knelt down by the side of the
basket, and slowly drew back the covering. "Ah!" he said&mdash;"it's cruel
work."</p>

<p>Did he refer to the chair-back? or did he refer to the way in which, for
the sake of gain, an honest dog had been MURDERED? For there before my
eyes lay the dead poodle, <i>Tommy Atkins</i>!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Alice</span> loses all her money," he continued, "but that doesn't matter. She
tells me that she's picked up no end of a swell down at Ryde, and he may
marry her. The question is&mdash;will he?" Once more I felt like a division
sum. I yearned to call out loudly, and answer with a decided negative;
but no words came. My strength was gone. I was utterly worked out, and
there was no remainder.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/069b.png">
<img src="images/069b.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>When I came to myself, I found <span class="smcap">James</span>, the waiter, standing by my bedside
with a gentleman whom I did not know. <span class="smcap">James</span> introduced him to me as a
Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span>, a photographer who was stopping in the hotel. Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span>
had been woken up by a wild shriek for a decided negative, and had
rushed down to see if he could do a little business. "Take you by the
electric light," he said; "just as you are,"&mdash;I was in my night-dress
and the old, old hat, the rim of which had been slightly
sprained,&mdash;"perfectly painless process, and money returned if not
satisfactory." I thanked him warmly, and apologised for having disturbed
him.</p>

<p>I went to London on the following day. I felt it my positive duty to
explain that I should always regard <span class="smcap">Alice Smith</span> as a sister, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>I had quite forgotten that I did not know the house where <span class="smcap">Alice Smith</span>
lived, and the poodle dog lay dead.</p>

<h2>"SWEET-MARJORIE!"</h2>

<img src="images/071b.png" width="100%" alt="Change for a Tenor" /></a><br /><br />
<p>Change for a Tenor. Wilfred of Huntington is succeeded by
that Man of Mark&mdash;Tapley.</p>
</div>

<p>Take it all in all, <i>Marjorie</i> at the Prince of "Wales' is a very
satisfactory production. The subject is English, the music is English,
and the "book" is English too. So when we applaud the new Opera, we have
the satisfaction of knowing that our cheers are given in the cause of
native talent triumphant. This is appropriate to the "time" of the play
(the commencement of the thirteenth century), which is the very epoch
when the Saxons were beginning to hold their own in the teeth of their
Norman conquerors. But leaving patriotism out of the question (a matter
which, it is to be feared, is not likely to influence Stalls, Pit, and
Gallery materially for a very lengthened period), the Opera <i>qu&acirc;</i> Opera
is a very good one. The company is strong&mdash;so strong, that it hears the
loss of an accomplished songstress like Miss <span class="smcap">Huntington</span> without severely
suffering. It is true that an excellent substitute for the lady has been
found in that tenor with the cheerful name, Mr. <span class="smcap">Mark Tapley</span>, whose notes
are certainly worth their weight in gold; but leaving the
representatives of <i>Wilfred</i> "outside the competition," the remainder of
the <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> are excellent. They work well together, and
consequently the <i>ensemble</i> is in the highest degree pleasing.</p>

<p>Assistance of rather a graver character than usually associated with
comic opera is naturally afforded by Mr. <span class="smcap">Haydyn Coffin</span>. Miss <span class="smcap">Phyllis
Broughton</span> is introduced not only to sing but to dance, and performs the
latter accomplishment with a grace not to be surpassed, and only to be
equalled by Miss <span class="smcap">Kate Vaughan</span>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Ashley</span>, now happily returned to the
melodious paths from which he strayed to play in pieces of the calibre
of <i>Pink Dominoes</i>, seems quite at home in the character of <i>Sir
Simon</i>&mdash;not "the Cellarer," but rather, "the sold one." Mr. <span class="smcap">Monkhouse</span>,
whose name and personality go to prove that a cowl does not preclude its
occasional occupation by a wag, is most amusing as <i>Gosric</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Albert
James</span> is a lively jester, whose quips and cranks might have been of
considerable value to Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Miller</span> when that literary droll was
engaged in compiling his comic classic. Miss <span class="smcap">D'arville</span> and Madame <span class="smcap">Amadi</span>
both work with a will, and find a way to public favour. The dresses are
in excellent taste, and the scenery capital.</p>

<p>That the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> is perfect, goes without saying, as this Opera
has been produced by that past master of stage-direction, the one and
only <span class="smcap">Augustus Druriolanus</span>. The dialogue is sufficiently pointed&mdash;not too
pointed, but pointed enough. It does not require a knowledge of the
niceties of the law, the regulations of the British army, or a keen
appreciation of the subtlest subtleties of logic to fully understand it.
It is amusing, and provocative of innocent laughter, which, after all,
seems to be a sufficient recommendation for words spoken within the
walls of a play-house. The music is full of melody&mdash;"quite killing," as
a young lady wittily observed, on noticing that the name of the Composer
was <span class="smcap">Slaughter</span>. So <i>Marjorie</i> may be fairly said not only to have
deserved success, but (it is satisfactory to be able to add) also to
have attained it.</p>

<h2>STATESMEN AT HOME.</h2>

<center>DCXLIII. <span class="smcap">The Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, M.P., at Hawarden.</span></center>

<div class="figleft1" style="width:100%">

</div>

<p><b><sub>S</sub></b> you approach the historic home of the great English Statesman who is
to be your host to-day, you become conscious of the fact that there are
two Hawarden Castles. Moreover, as young <span class="smcap">Herbert</span> pleasantly remarks a
little later in the day, "You must draw a Hawarden-fast line between the
two." One, standing on a hill dominating a far-reaching tract of level
country, was already so old in the time of <span class="smcap">Edward the First</span> that it was
found necessary to rebuild it. Looking through your Domesday Book (which
you always carry with you on these excursions), you find the mansion
referred to under the style of Haordine. This, antiquarians assume, is
the Saxonised form of the earlier British <i>Y&nbsp;Garthddin</i>, which, being
translated, means "The hill-fort on the projecting ridge."</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">William the Conqueror</span> came over, bringing with him a following the
numerical proportions of which increase as the years roll by, he found
the Fort on the Hill held by <span class="smcap">Edward</span> of Mercia, and deemed it convenient
to leave it in his possession. The Castle played its part in English
history down to the time, now 130 years gone by, when it came into the
hands of Sir <span class="smcap">John Glynn</span>, and thence through long descent became an
inheritance of the gracious lady who, with cambric cap-strings streaming
in the free air of the Marches, joins your host in welcoming you.</p>

<p>It is, however, not on the steps of the old castle of which Prince
<span class="smcap">Llewellyn</span> was once lord that you are thus received. By the side of the
old ruin has grown up another Hawarden Castle, a roomy mansion,
statelily stuccoed, with sham turrets run up, buttresses, embrasures,
portholes, and portcullises, putting to shame the rugged, looped and
windowless ruin that still stands on the projecting ridge. This dates
only from the beginning of the century, and, looking upon it, your face
glows with honest pride, as you think how much better the generation
near your own made for itself dwelling-houses compared with the earlier
English.</p>

<p>Whilst you stand musing on these things you are conscious of a whishing
sound, and a breath of swiftly moving cool air wantonly strikes your
cheek. You look up and behold! there is your host, axe in hand,
playfully performing a number of passes over your unconscious head. His
dress is designed admirably to suit the exercise. Coat and waistcoat are
doffed; the immortal collars are turned down, displaying the columnar
throat and the brawny chest; the snow-white shirt-sleeves are turned up
to the elbow, disclosing biceps that <span class="smcap">Samson</span> would envy and <span class="smcap">Sandow</span> covet.
His braces are looped on either side of his supple hips, and his right
hand grasps the axe which, a moment ago had been performing over your
head a series of evolutions which, remarkable for the strength and
agility displayed, were, perhaps, scarcely desirable for daily
repetition.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, <span class="smcap">Toby</span> M.P.," said the full rich voice so familiar
in the House of Commons; "it's our wild woodsman's way of welcoming the
coming guest. What do you think of my costume? Seen it before? Ah!
<i>yes</i>, the photographs. <i>Carte de visite style</i>, <i>10s. 6d.</i> a dozen;
Cabinet size, a guinea. I have been photographed several times as you
will observe."</p>

<p>And, indeed, as your host leads you along the stately passages, through
the storied rooms, you find his photograph everywhere. The tables are
covered with them, showing your host in all attitudes and costumes.
"Yes," he says, with a sigh, "I think I have marched up to the camera's
mouth as often as most men of my years."</p>

<p>Ascending the rustic staircase which leads from the garden, <span class="smcap">William
Ewart Gladstone</span> takes you past the library into the drawing-room, in the
upper parts of the leaded windows of which are inserted panels of rare
old glass, cunningly obtained by melting superfluous Welsh ale bottles.
He leads you to a table, as round as that at which a famous Conference
was held, and points to a little ivory painting. It shows a chubby
little boy some two years of age, with rather large head and broad
shoulders, sitting at the knee of a young nymph approaching her fifth
year. On her knee is a book, and the chubby boy, with dark hair falling
low over his forehead, his great brown eyes staring frankly at you,
points with his finger to a passage. When you learn that this is a
portrait of your host and his sister taken in the year 1811, you
naturally come to the conclusion that the young lady has, for party
purposes, been misquoting some passages in her brother's speech, and
that he, having produced an authorised record of his address, is
triumphantly pointing to the text in controversion of her statement.</p>

<p>Your host, chopping grimly at the furniture as he passes along&mdash;here
dexterously severing the leg of a Chippendale chair, and there hacking a
piece off a Louis Quatorze couch&mdash;leads the way to an annexe he has just
built for the reception of his treasured books. From the outside this
excrescence on the Castle has but a poverty-stricken look. It is, to
tell the truth, made of corrugated iron. But that is a cloak that
cunningly covers an interior of rare beauty and rich design. Arras of
cloth of gold hangs loosely on the walls, whilst here and there, on the
far-reaching floor, gleams the low light of a faded Turkey carpet. Open
tables, covered with broad cloths of crimson velvet, embroidered and
fringed with gold, carry innumerable Blue Books. On marble tables,
supported on carved and gilded frames, stand priceless vases, filled
with rare flowers. In crystal flagons you detect the sheen of amber
light (which may be sherry wine), whilst the ear is lulled with the
sound of fountains dispensing perfumes as of Araby. In an alcove,
chastely draped with violent violet velvet, the grey apes swing, and the
peacocks preen, on fretted pillar and jewelled screen. Horologes, to
chime the hours, and even the quarters, uprise from tables of
ebony-and-mother-of-pearl. Cabinets from Ind and Venice, of filligree
gold and silver, enclose complete sets of <i>Hansard's Parliamentary
Debates</i>; whilst lamps of silver, suspended from pendant pinnacles in
the fretted ceiling, shed a soft light over the varied mass of colour.</p>

<p>Casting himself down lightly by a cabinet worked with Dutch beads
interspersed with seed-pearls, and toying with the gnarled handle of the
axe, the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">William Ewart Gladstone</span> tells you the story of his
life. At the outset you are a little puzzled to gather where exactly he
was born. At first you think it was in Scotland. Anon some town in
England claims the honour. Then Wales is incidentally mentioned, and
next the tearful voice of Erin claims her son. But, as the story goes
forward with long majestic stride, these difficulties fade in the
glamour of the Old Man's eloquence, and when you awake and find your
host has not yet got beyond the second course&mdash;the fish, as it were, of
the intellectual banquet&mdash;you say you will call again.</p>

<p>Mention of the three courses naturally suggests dinner, and as you
evidently enjoy the monopoly of the mental association, you take your
leave, perhaps regretting that among his wild woodsman accessories your
host does not seem to include the midday chop.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Gold-tipped</span> cigarettes seem just now to be "the swagger thing." "Ah!"
Master <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> sighed, as he set off for school with only five shillings
in his pocket, in consequence of all his dearest&mdash;and nearest&mdash;relatives
being laid up with the prevailing epidemic, "Ah, how I should like to be
one of those cigarettes, and then I should be tipped with gold."</p>
